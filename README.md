* This package can be used in two different ways:  
  * If you want to use it as a downloader only, then you can simply use its CLI.  
  * But if you are a more advanced user and want to use this package in your projects, then you can import it in your project and you're good to go.
* With this package you will be able to save any **Music**, **Video (Music Video & RJ-TV Show)**, **Album**, **Podcast** and **Playlist** from [RadioJavan](https://www.radiojavan.com/) to your personal computer.  
* *Podcasts* will be saved in **192 kbps** quality only, while you can choose between **256 kbps** and **320 kbps** for *Songs (Albums & Playlists as well)*, and **480p**, **720p** and **1080p** for *Videos* if available.  
* If you are currently living in *Iran*, you need to turn on your **VPN** while using this package.

## Installation

* Use `pip install rjdl` to install the latest release of the package. (Of course to be able to use *pip*, you need python to be installed and added to computer's path first)  
* If you want to install the latest version directly from GitHub, then you can use this:  
`pip install git+git://github.com/reza00farjam/rjdl`

                        track(s) of Album/Playlist to be downloaded, separated
                        by white space (default: all tracks)
